  --lets see the average no of delay days
  SELECT AVG(delay_days) AS Average
FROM [AdventureWorks2019].[Production].[WorkOrder]

-- LETS SEE THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE DELAY DAYS 
SELECT STDEV(delay_days) AS Standard_deviation
FROM [Production].[WorkOrder]

* A view 'Hottest_stores' was created
* This view joins the Customer table and the Sales Territory table using the TerritoryID
* After this was done the stores with the highest number of customers were then obtained using the GROUP BY clause and ORDER BY 

```sql
    CREATE VIEW [Hottest_stores]
  AS
  SELECT [CustomerID]
      ,[StoreID]
      ,cust.[TerritoryID]
	  ,[Name]
      ,[CountryRegionCode]
      ,[Group]
FROM [AdventureWorks2019].[Sales].[Customer] AS cust
INNER JOIN [AdventureWorks2019].[Sales].[SalesTerritory] AS territory

FROM [Hottest_stores]
GROUP BY StoreID
ORDER BY Number_of_customers DESC
```
### Output:

StoreID |	Number_of_customers |
  -- | -- |
NULL |	18484 |
700 |	2 |
388 |	2 |
302 |	2 |
1868 |	2 |
1370 |	2 |
600 |	2 |
  
* Without the group by function, there were about 7 stores that had no unique store ID, this is why the number of customers in stores with 'NULL' as the store ID is extremely high
* However, this doesnt change the fact that most of the stores with large number of customers do not have unique IDs. 
* Most of the other stores had 2 or 1 customer(s) only. 
* This is not the complete output.

### 11. Does Sell Cheapy Retail get higher number of customers when the tax rate increases OR NOT?

* Then, another view 'tax_range' was created using the 'sales_data' view to count the number of sales for each tax range

```sql
CREATE VIEW [sales_data] 
AS 
SELECT [SalesOrderID],
[TaxAmt],
CASE
WHEN [TaxAmt] <= 300 THEN 1
WHEN [TaxAmt] <= 500 THEN 2
WHEN [TaxAmt] <= 1000 THEN 3
WHEN [TaxAmt] <= 2000 THEN 4
WHEN [TaxAmt] <= 3000 THEN 5
WHEN [TaxAmt] <= 5000 THEN 6
WHEN [TaxAmt] <= 10000 THEN 7
WHEN [TaxAmt] <= 15000 THEN 8
ELSE 9
END AS tax_range
FROM [AdventureWorks2019].[Sales].[SalesOrderHeader]


CREATE VIEW [tax_range]
AS
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT [SalesOrderID]) AS number_of_sales,
CONCAT((tax_range - 1) * 500 + 1, '-', tax_range * 500) AS the_range
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY tax_range


SELECT *
FROM [tax_range]
ORDER BY number_of_sales DESC
```
### Output:

number_of_sales |	the_range
  -- | -- |
28952 |	1-500 |
625 |	2501-3000 |
420 |	3001-3500 |
411 |	2001-2500 |
381 |	1001-1500 |
326 |	501-1000 |
302 |	1501-2000 |
46 |	3501-4000 |
2 |	4001-4500 |
  
* As seen from the table above, as the tax range increases the number of sales reduces
