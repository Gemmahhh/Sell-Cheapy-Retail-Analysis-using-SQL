## Use Case
A chain of department stores called SellCheapy Retail offers a variety of goods, including bicycles and various parts. Despite having a sizable consumer base, 
the business has had trouble growing its sales recently. The management team wants to increase performance by using data analysis to better understand consumer 
spending habits and alter sales and marketing tactics.

Over the course of a year, the business gathered information on customer demographics, past purchases, and other pertinent facts. 
The data contains details on the items bought, the cost, the date of purchase, etc.

The goal is to use this data to analyze the business challenge and offer solutions.

## Dashboard
Figma was used to create the dashboardâ€™s background. The ability to correctly tweak the icons and modify their texture to better fit my needs was made easy with Figma.

After that, Tableau was used to build the dashboard. At this point, all I did was combine the charts that had already been made in 
Tableau and arranged the dashboard appropriately.
